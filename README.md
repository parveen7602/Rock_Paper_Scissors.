# Rock_Paper_Scissors.
# overview:
This is a beginner-friendly **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using Python.  
The player competes against the computer, which makes a random choice between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.  
The winner is decided based on the traditional rules of the game.


# Game Rules:
Rock vs Scissors → Rock wins
Scissors vs Paper → Scissors wins
Paper vs Rock → Paper wins
If both make the same choice → It’s a Draw

# Logic:
0 → Rock  
1 → Paper  
2 → Scissors
The computer randomly selects a value between **0 and 2**,and the user provides their choice through console input.  
The program then compares both values to determine the winner.
